          'Aging is an inevitable course of life. Additionally, the risk of chronic diseases or cancer increases with age. The comprehensive identification of signs related to aging can be beneficial for the prevention and early diagnosis of geriatric diseases. The comparison of global modifications in the urine proteome is a means of multidimensional information mining. This approach is based on urine, in which changes from whole-body metabolism can accumulate. This study used the urine of healthy people at different ages (22 children, 10 young people, 6 senior people) as the research object and using high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, label-free quantitation combined with non-limiting modification identification algorithms and random group test, compared the differences in protein chemical modifications among three groups. The results show that multi-sites oxidative modifications and amino acid substitutions are noticeable features that distinguish these three age groups of people. The proportion of multi-site oxidations in urine proteins of senior (29.76%) is significantly higher than the young group (13.71% and 12.97%), which affect the biological processes of various proteins. This study could provide a reference for studies of aging mechanisms and biomarkers of age-related disease.',

      content: {
        abstract:
          'Locust plagues threaten agricultural and environmental safety throughout the world1,2. Aggregation pheromones have a crucial role in the transition of locusts from a solitary form to the devastating gregarious form and the formation of large-scale swarms3,4. However, none of the candidate compounds reported5,6,7 meet all the criteria for a locust aggregation pheromone. Here, using behavioural assays, electrophysiological recording, olfactory receptor characterization and field experiments, we demonstrate that 4-vinylanisole (4VA) (also known as 4-methoxystyrene) is an aggregation pheromone of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). Both gregarious and solitary locusts are strongly attracted to 4VA, regardless of age and sex. Although it is emitted specifically by gregarious locusts, 4VA production can be triggered by aggregation of four to five solitary locusts. It elicits responses specifically from basiconic sensilla on locust antennae. We also identified OR35 as a specific olfactory receptor of 4VA. Knockout of OR35 using CRISPRâ€“Cas9 markedly reduced the electrophysiological responses of the antennae and impaired 4VA behavioural attractiveness. Finally, field trapping experiments verified the attractiveness of 4VA to experimental and wild populations. These findings identify a locust aggregation pheromone and provide insights for the development of novel control strategies for locusts.',

        'cDC1 prime and are licensed by CD4+ T cells to induce anti-tumour immunity',
      url: 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2611-3',
      content: {
        abstract:
          'Conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1)1 are thought to perform antigen cross-presentation, which is required to prime CD8+ T cells2,3, whereas cDC2 are specialized for priming CD4+ T cells4,5. CD4+ T cells are also considered to help CD8+ T cell responses through a variety of mechanisms6,7,8,9,10,11, including a process whereby CD4+ T cells license cDC1 for CD8+ T cell priming12. However, this model has not been directly tested in vivo or in the setting of help-dependent tumour rejection. Here we generated an Xcr1Cre mouse strain to evaluate the cellular interactions that mediate tumour rejection in a model requiring CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. As expected, tumour rejection required cDC1 and CD8+ T cell priming required the expression of major histocompatibility class I molecules by cDC1. Unexpectedly, early priming of CD4+ T cells against tumour-derived antigens also required cDC1, and this was not simply because they transport antigens to lymph nodes for processing by cDC2, as selective deletion of major histocompatibility class II molecules in cDC1 also prevented early CD4+ T cell priming. Furthermore, deletion of either major histocompatibility class II or CD40 in cDC1 impaired tumour rejection, consistent with a role for cognate CD4+ T cell interactions and CD40 signalling in cDC1 licensing. Finally, CD40 signalling in cDC1 was critical not only for CD8+ T cell priming, but also for initial CD4+ T cell activation. Thus, in the setting of tumour-derived antigens, cDC1 function as an autonomous platform capable of antigen processing and priming for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and of the direct orchestration of their cross-talk that is required for optimal anti-tumour immunity.',

        abstract:
          'Cell-to-cell communication is a crucial prerequisite for the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. To date, diverse mechanisms of intercellular exchange of information have been documented, including chemical synapses, gap junctions, and plasmodesmata. Here, we describe highly sensitive nanotubular structures formed de novo between cells that create complex networks. These structures facilitate the selective transfer of membrane vesicles and organelles but seem to impede the flow of small molecules. Accordingly, we propose a novel biological principle of cell-to-cell interaction based on membrane continuity and intercellular transfer of organelles.',
