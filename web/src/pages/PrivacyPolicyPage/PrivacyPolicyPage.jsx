        <p>
          Labspoon is built with strong security features that continuously
          protect your information. We work hard to protect you and Labspoon
          from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of
          information we hold, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit.</li>
          <li>
            We review our information collection, storage, and processing
            practices, including physical security measures, to prevent
            unauthorised access to our systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            We restrict access to personal information to only those Labspoon
            employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in
            order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict
            contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or
            terminated if they fail to meet those obligations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When you share your information</h3>
        <p>
          Labspoon lets you share information with other people. You have
          control over how and what you share. For example, you can share
          comments and posts on Labspoon publically. Remember, when you share
          information publicly, your content may become accessible through
          search engines.
        </p>
        <h3>When we share your information</h3>
        <p>
          We do not share your personal information with companies,
          organisation, or individuals outside of Labspoon except in the
          following cases:
        </p>
        <h4>With your consent</h4>
        <p>
          We&#39;ll share personal information outside of Labspoon when we have
          your consent, for instance if you want to share your email address
          with another user.
        </p>
        <h4>For external processing</h4>
        <p>
          We share personal information with our affiliates and other trusted
          businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions
          and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
          confidentiality and security measures.
        </p>
        <h4>For legal reasons</h4>
        <p>
          We will share personal information outside of Labspoon if we believe
          that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is
          reasonably necessary to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable
            governmental request.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of
            potential violations.

            Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical
            issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Labspoon,
            our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with
          our partners - like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights
          holders.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Labspoon is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets,
          we&#39;ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal
          information and give affected users notice before personal information
          is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Retaining your information</h3>
        <p>
          We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending
          on what it is and how we use it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content you
            create or upload.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period
            of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            We keep some data until you delete your Labspoon account, such as
            information about how often you use our services.
          </li>
          <li>
            And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary
            for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud
            and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that
          your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or
          retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services
          protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of
          this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when
          copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
        </p>

        <h3>With your consent</h3>
        <p>
